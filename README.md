Amazon's Alexa team is working on optimizing the customer experience for scenarios where customers ask generic question. One example of a generic question is "what are good vegetarian restaurant nearby?" In this example, Alexa would then search for all vegetarian restaurant in the city and select the nearest x vegetarian restaurant relation in the city, implement an algorithm to find the nearest x vegetarian restaurant to the customer's location.
